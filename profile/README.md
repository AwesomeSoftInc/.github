Projects related to an unnamed friend group. Mostly games, sometimes websites and Minecraft plugins.

The philsoophy of the guy who actually pushes to most of the repos here is to open source:

- Libraries that could be useful to other developers.
- Software that other developers might be interested in forking/running.
- Anything we are legally required to open source.
